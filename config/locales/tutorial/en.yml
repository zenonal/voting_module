                <p>This little window is here to provide you valuable information to start using this website.
                You can deactivate it at anytime.</p>
                <p>The objective of this website is twofold: allowing you to vote on propositions of 
                laws or policies recently put forth by our politicians, and allowing you to submit your own proposals and vote on
                proposals of other citizens.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to explore this website, vote and share your ideas!</p>"
    
    user:
      show: "<p>Here you can see all the public activity of users. Public activity includes initiatives, amendments and points 
                of views that have been posted. It does not include the private votes of course.</p>
            <p>If this is the profile of a user that has chosen to become a delegate, you will be able to see how this user
             voted as a delegate on all the proposals. You can then choose to delegate your votes to this user if you want to.
            By doing that, you won't have to vote on each proposal anymore. Each time the delegate will vote, 
            you will vote automatically the same. <br/> Of course if you decide to vote yourself, your own vote overrides the one from your delegate.<br/>
            You can also cancel your delegation or change your delegate at any time. Finally, you can also choose to become a delegate yourself.

    initiatives:

                  <br />You can extend or narrow down the selection of initiatives that are shown here by clicking on the \"options\" button.</p>
                <p>Click on one of the proposals to see the details and vote.</p>"

                <p>A citizen initiative will pass successively through 5 stages:
                <p>The first stage is the editing stage, during which the authors of the bill 
                have one week to edit the content of the bill until it suits them. Other users can leave messages to help them improve their draft.</p>
                <p>The second stage is the validation stage. During this period, users can validate the bill by clicking on the checkmark on the left of this page. 
                Once the validation threshold is reached (3% of the currently active users), the bill passes to the next phase. If the bill does not
                reach validation in 2 weeks, it is eliminated.</p>
                <p>The third stage is the amendment phase. During this phase, other users can propose alternative bills, called amendments. </p>
                <p>During the fourth stage, you can (at last) vote on the bill and rank it in comparison to all the other proposed amendments. </p>
                <p>Finally, when the voting period is over, the results of the vote are shown.</p>"
