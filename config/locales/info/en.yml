    Click on the links to have more details or edit your user information."
    featured_title: "Examples of bills picked randomly for you."
    options: "Filter the bills according to their geographical extent, their category and their developmemnt phase"
    category: "Defines the domain to which the bills apply (e.g. economy, agriculture, etc...)."
    geography: "Defines the geographical level of the bills (communal, provincial, regional, federal).</br>
        If you are using a subdomain such as http://bruxelles.votingmodule.heroku.com then the geographical level will be automatically
        set to Brussels and you won't be able to change it here. If you want to access bills in other geographical level, you can either
        use another subdomain (e.g. http://antwerpen.votingmodule.heroku.com) or use no subdomain (e.g. http://votingmodule.heroku.com)."
    phase: "Defines the current processing phase of the bills:
            <ul><li>currently being edited: the bill is being drafter by its author</li>
            <li>curently gathering validations: the bill is gathering validations from other users. It needs to pass a validation threshold to go on to the next steps.</li>
            <li>validation failed: the bill didn't reach the validation threshold in time. It won't go on to the next steps.</li>
            <li>currently open to amendments: the bill is open to amendment. Anyone can propose alternative proposals.</li>
            <li>currently being voted on: the bill is being voted on</li>
            <li>already voted on: the voting period is over. You can see the results of the vote. </li></ul>
            By default, all phases are shown except the editing phase."
    outside_geo: "By default, in addition to federal bills, only bills from your own commune, province and region are shown. </br>
        You can see the bills from other geographical sectors by checking this option."
    sign_in_through_social_networks: "You can sign in very easily through one of these social networks.</br>
     If you have an account with one of these, you can just click on the corresponding icon </br> and you will be authenticated automatically through their website."
    brainstorm: "This is the place where ideas are proposed anonymously and are voted on. </br> You can propose anything that comes to your mind in relation to the corresponding bill. "
    edit_bill: "This allows you to modify the bill. Keep in mind that this will be possible only for a limited amount of time though."
    percent_approval: "This shows the percentage of votes in which this bill was given a positive ranking. </br>
        Because the votes are based on ranking instead of simply 'yes' or 'no', </br>
        this measure of percentage of approval does not reliably indicates which bill, if any, passed the vote."
    average_ranking: "This shows how the bill was ranked on average, with respect to the other bills. The higher the score, the more this bill is considered superior to the other bills."
    rank_matrix: "This is a way of summarizing the results by showing the number of votes in which each bill was ranked higher than each other bill.</br>
    From this table of result, we calculate the winner of the vote with the so-called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Condorcet_method&oldid=454655093'>Condorcet method</a>."
    delegates_rankings: "This shows how each delegate voted on this bill. A delegate is a citizen whom you can choose to represent you. </br>
        In this case, each time he votes on a bill, he votes also for you. You can change delegate or override his vote anytime you like. </br>
        You can also choose to be a delegate yourself. </br>Click on you user name in the upper right corner to know more about that."
    private_rankings: "This is a list of all the votes on this bill. </br>
    This gives users a possibility to check that their vote was indeed counted without revealing the identity of the voters."
    
    amendments_title: "This section shows the alternative proposals that other users have proposed. </br></br>
    Like the other bills, these proposals have first to be validated, i.e. to be supported by enough voters.</br>
    If you see here under the title 'These alternatives have not been validated yet' proposals that you like, please go ahead and validate them.</br></br>
    You can also propose alternatives yourself. But this can be done only during a limited period of time, after the original bill has been validarted, and before the vote!</br>  
    When the vote takes place, each voter ranks all the proposals, including the original one, in the order of his preference.</br>
    The winner will be the bill which is ranked before the other ones most of the time (Condorcet method)."
    
    argument_title: "Here you can place a relatively elaborated comment on what you think about the bill. You can see this as a mini newspaper op-ed if you like.</br>
    To keep things clear, we separated the columns with pros and cons points of view.</br></br> These points of views cannot be commented. "
    
    discussion_title: "This section is for debate. You can post your comment and reply to other's comments. </br>
    Please post only comments that are relevant to the discussion. If you see irrelevant or abusive comments, you can flag them."
    
    delegation_title: "This section gives information on delegation, which is the core of fluid democracy.</br>
    You can choose any person you like to be your delegate. Once done so, everytime this person votes, she votes for you as well.</br></br>
    The good part, which makes this system very different from the usual representative system, is that you can vote yourself instead on any bill.</br>
    If you do so, your vote overrides the one from your delegate. </br></br>Very importantly also, you can change your delegate at anytime! </br>
    Finally, you can also naturally propose yourself as a delegate. You just have to click a button. That's all."
    
    info_initiative: "An initiative is the draft of a new law, proposed by a citizen or a group of citizens. Anyone can propose an initiative. <br>
    Once submitted, it needs to gather a certain number of signatures to prove that it is valuable. Then it is submitted to a general vote. 
    If it's a communal law, it's voted by all the citizens of the commune, if it's a federal law, it's voted by all the citizens of the country."    
    
    info_referendum: "A referendum is a vote organized to approve or disapprove a law proposed by politicians.
    There are two crucial aspects of a referendum that can make it a true democratic tool in the hand of the people. <br>
    First it needs to be binding, i.e. the result makes law. No one can overcome it (except the people themselves through an initiative for example). 
    Second it needs to be citizen-initiated. In many countries, the politicians decide themselves when to put a law to referendum. 
    Then it becomes a way for them to increase their power. In contrast, citizen-initiated referendums allow citizens to oppose a real counter-power to the politicians."
    
    info_future_website: "There will be three important differences in the real party website. 
    <ul>
        <li>You will identify yourself by means of your electronic ID card, insuring safe identification.</li> 
        <li>The privacy of the votes will be better secured thanks to a system called <a href='http://heliosvoting.org/'>Helios</a></li>
        <li>What will be decided on the website will then determine the agenda of the party!</li>
    </ul>"
    
    info_candidate: "Our candidates will take part to the 2012 communal elections. If they get elected, they pledge to respect the will of the people, i.e.
    they will vote in the communal assembly <em>strictly</em> in accordance with the results of the vote obtained on the website. In other words, you decide and 
    they speak for you.</br></br>
    We need candidates so don't hesitate to  <a href='mailto:zenon.alex@gmail.com'> propose yourself! </a> In the future, candidates will be selected by 
    <a href= 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition'>sortition</a> 
    but for our first participation to the elections, the first ones to propose a valid candidacy will be chosen."
    
    commune_search: "Enter the postal code of the commune you want to connnect to. You will then see only proposals for this particular commune in addition to 
    federal proposals."
    private_vote_num: "Number of votes you casted privately."
    public_vote_num: "Number of votes you casted as a delegate."
    submitted_bill_num: "Number of bills you submitted. These can be either initiatives or amendments to other proposals."
    comments_num: "Number of comments you posted."
    points_of_view_num: "Number of points of view you posted."
    validation_help: "All the bills are not systematically voted on. They first need to gather a certain amount of social support. This support is evaluated by means
        of validations. If you think a bill should be voted on, just click on the validate button. </br>
        As soon as the criterion has been met (3% of the electorate in principle, but on this website, it is 3% of the users in the corresponding geographical level)
        , the bill goes to the next stage. </br>
        This is true also for referendum. When referendums are placed on the website, they need first to be validated before they can be voted on."
