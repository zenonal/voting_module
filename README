Jegouverne.be / Ikregeer.be is an e-voting platform developped in Ruby on Rails. It implements liquid democracy with proxy voting. 

Its initial purpose was to be an experimental website allowing to try and test different e-voting related functionalities. So it is quite messy in its current form, lacks robustness and security and it is not commented yet. To speed up development, there was no testing implemented either. 
But this will need to be changed if we want to use it as an actual e-voting platform. 

Authentication is based on the devise and omniauth gems. 

CSS code is created by the sass gem.

It uses Paperclip for image uploading and Redcloth for text editing.
