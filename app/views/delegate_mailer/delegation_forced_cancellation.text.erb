<%= @user.displayName %>,

<%= @delegate.user.displayName %> just cancelled his delegate mandate. You are thus no longer delegating your votes to this user. You can either <%= link_to "choose another delegate", delegates_url %> or remain without a delegate.

Of course, all the past votes of this delegate will remain valid.
